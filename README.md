## Features

### General Features:
- **Evidence Management**: Secure upload and storage of evidence files using MongoDB GridFS.
- **Immutable Evidence**: Evidence cannot be altered after submission; additional details can only be appended.
- **User Authentication**: Role-based login for admins and investigators.

### Implemented CNS Aspects:
1. **Encryption of Sensitive Data**:  
   - Uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode to encrypt evidence and case details.  

2. **Immutable Evidence**:  
   - Ensures evidence integrity by preventing modifications to original files while allowing appends.  

3. **Password Hashing**:  
   - Hashes passwords using Django's `make_password` method and verifies them with `check_password`.  

4. **Secure Storage**:  
   - Utilizes MongoDB GridFS for storing large forensic files securely with encryption.  

5. **CSRF Protection**:  
   - Prevents unauthorized commands using Django's default CSRF protection.

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ifrahnz26/evidensecure.git
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
   ```bash
   cd evidensecure

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies
1. Install all necessary dependencies using the requirements.txt file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. If you donâ€™t have the requirements.txt file, generate it:
    ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt

###Step 3: Set Up the Database
1. Start MongoDB:
   ```bash
   mongod 
2. Connect to MongoDB using the following settings:
   Database Name: EvidenSecure_db
   Sample Python connection:
   ```bash
   from pymongo import MongoClient
   client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
   db = client['EvidenSecure_db']
3. Import sample data if available:
   ```bash
   mongoimport --db EvidenSecure_db --collection users --file sample-users.json

###Step 4: Configure the Project
1. Update database settings in settings.py:
   ```bash
   DATABASES = {
        'default': {
                   'ENGINE': 'djongo',
                   'NAME': 'EvidenSecure_db',
         }
   }

###Step 5: Run the Application
1. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
3. Access the application at:
    [http://127.0.0.1:8000](..)
